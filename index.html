            <p>Hi! My name is Aba Otchere, and I'm a Freshman pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. </p>
            <p>I've been a member of the Church since birth, but I wasn't baptized until I was 9 years old because I wanted my sister to witness it. She had gone on an exchange program, and I chose to wait until she returned.</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, I love baking too!</p>
